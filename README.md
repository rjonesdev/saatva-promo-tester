# Saatva Promotions Tester Extension

## Functionality
### Currently Functioning
  - Updating copy for sitewide banner
  - Updating copy for PDP banner
  - Bolding text within banners (only works once without refresh and/or text update)
### Next Steps
  - Add ability to update copy for sales page banner
  - Add ability to edit second row of PDP banner copy
  - Character countdown next to the banner copy (not a hard limit, but just to show it's there)
### Ideal End Goal
  - Allow for updating banner colors
  - Add ability to underline/bold/italicize/mock links in any banner copy any arbitrary amount of times
  - Persist the values in the extension when it's closed so you don't have to retype every time
  - Use extension to force different tab sizes (mobile, desktop, tablet) without having to open up the google inspect element tool.
